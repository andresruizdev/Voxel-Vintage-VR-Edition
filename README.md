# What is Voxel Vintage?
Voxel Vintage is a game focused on voxel futuristic art style according to the game time. In the game, you are basically a Voxeltown citizen and you go to visit a place called Voxel Vintage Museum, where you can find things that you consider very old, because you are in the year 2058, in each section you can see how this objects looked before and also interact with some of them.

# Planning and Sketching
In the planning process, I took the liberty of searching objects around me, basic things that made up my daily life, which are prone to extinguish or completely change in the future and this is how I though about the objects.

I use Voxel Art like visuals, a lightweight visual style based on cubes, which allowed me to have a more optimal scene to use lights and give the aspect that I preferred to the game.

During the planning I made different sketches of the museum, of which I prefer the following one:

# Development Process
Issues and problems during the development
During the development I didn’t have many problems, nevertheless, I had some issues mainly trying to use Occlusion Culling in the project and the performance, when I bake the Occlusion Culling, Unity generated errors because it interfered with the Post-Processing Plugin, so I declined using the Post-Processing Plugin in the scene, because the game performance was affected by this plugin too. Later, I implemented the Occlusion Culling to the scene and the performance is better now. I had problems with the text too, because is different how the text looks on the editor from the final game.

# Testing
Testing the game, I could notice that the game have an fps downgrade, mainly when you turn to see other things on the Scene, and the user couldn’t see the text correctly.
